# holbertonschool-simple_shell

Project Description

holbertonschool-simple_shell is a simple Unix command-line interpreter developed in the C programming language.

This project was created by Lala Ibadullayeva and Okan Mahmudov as part of the first trimester curriculum at Holberton School. Development took place from April 21st, 2025 to May 4th, 2025.

The shell mimics core functionalities of traditional Unix shells such as bash, with support for:

Executing commands via fork() and execve().
Handling basic built-in commands like env and exit.
